Hr Analytics Dashboard
Hey Everyone,
I have created a HR Analytics Dashboard on Power BI that shows the detailed attrition analysis of employees within an organization.

The key learnings from this project include:
-Data Cleaning
-Data Processing
-Data Visualization
-Understanding DAX expressions and Measures
use of KPIs, donut charts, clustered bar charts, area charts, tree maps, Filters, Slicers, Clustered column charts, etc.

Huge thanks to Rishabh Mishra for valuable guidance.
